# bme280
just some bme280 fun and nodejs I forked the library for the BME from https://github.com/fivdi/bme2.
First I wanted to make some changes but very soon realized I didn't have to for what I'm doing.

However if you hook up both your BME sensors in this configuration like I have on my Raspberry Pi3B here, this should work out of the box.
